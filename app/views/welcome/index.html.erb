				Few things irk Julie Marie Mansfield more than the people who know a child is being sexually abused and say or do nothing.

				<p>Starting at age eight, Julie was the victim of molestation, incest, rape, violence and abuse, primarily at the hands of her uncles. It’s an abuse that started in Jamaica and ended in the United States, almost a decade later. Then, following the death of her grandfather in 2000, Julie decided to return to ground zero, confronting the genesis of a life of abuse. It was just after the funeral when she decided to visit the ‘path’ where she was first abused, only to find the path wholly impenetrable. That, she took as a sign to let go, to seek help in releasing the pains of the past; as a steering away from living in shame and guilt. And so the conversations began and what came out was indeed a shock: four of her eight maternal uncles were chronic abusers, some abusing their own daughters. In talking with family members, there was a chorus: ME TOO. The closure of that ‘path,’ you could say, was the beginning of a new journey</p>

 <div class="mgwb">
   <p><strong><em>Maybe God Was Busy</em></strong> is an unfiltered memoir of growing up behind the tourist veil of Jamaica, one of the most beloved
   islands in the world. It is a raw, unaltered look at an idyllic childhood interrupted by chronic childhood sexual abuse. From molestation by one
   uncle, to rape by another, to rape by the "church brother", to rape by the voodoo practicitoner charged with saving a dying brother, to a pregnancy
   and anesthetic-free abortion at age 15, to cousins falling victim to incest, everything is revealed. <strong><em>Maybe God Was Busy</em></strong>
   questions the complicity of those who knew, but accepted the abuse as 'family business', refusing to take steps necessary to protect the victims,
   instead going above and beyond to protect the 'family name.' <strong><em>Maybe God Was Busy</em></strong> is truly raw and authentic - a memoir
   saturated with abuse, survival, forgiveness, triumph and redemption.</p>
